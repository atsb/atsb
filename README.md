Note:

This is detailing which projects have gone where.

* All projects that are NOT Doom, Quake or otherwise Game (Except my Roguelike ports) related have been transferred to: https://gitlab.com/atsb
* All projects that ARE game related have been transferred to sourceforge: https://sourceforge.net/u/atsb/
* All projects that ARE FOSS related (Debian/GNU) have been transferred to repo.or.cz due to its use of strictly free JS and thus any of my fellow FOSS contributors do not need to install non-free Javascript (ongoing)

Everything you see on my github currently (except those above) will be staying put.  Those primarily are Nose-PY3, Wrathplaces, Source port builds and RL_M (Larn).

It is easier for me to manage all of this with nice, clear separation, I had over 75 repositories here that I actively worked on and managing it all was utter hell.
