My Sourceforge (where projects that are 'done' and in purely maintenance mode go to retire): https://sourceforge.net/u/atsb/profile
My Gitlab (where misc projects that are no longer developed belong): https://gitlab.com/atsb

Some of these may have crossovers of some projects on GitHub (usually older versions that I am too lazy to remove).  So in this case, consider the ones on GitHub more updated.
