Notice 31/07/2022: My Intel Mac died after 9 years.  I will be transitioning all my work to my RHEL system and will no longer be working on any Mac programs.  There is an M1 Mac at home, however it is not mine and so that isn't possible to develop on as I need at least 50GB of developer tools and the significant other would not be pleased.

Therefore, expect all my Mac projects to unfortunately close.  Going forward, Red Hat Enterprise Linux will be my number 1 platform and I will be cross-compiling for Windows.  I have neither the time nor energy to consistently use multiple machines anymore.

Notice 12/09/2022: I am slowly moving all my popular and / or projects that are largely finished to SourceForge.  I dislike where Github is going and I want space to code, not to earn stupid badges and have 'social media' features.  Nor do I want to ellicit and assumption that my work with the GNU project is somehow tied to MS.  For those projects that are small and or under GPL licenses, I will be moving those to my repo cz account.

Eventually my Github will be permanently shutdown and closed.
