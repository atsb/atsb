Note: 30.09.2022 - some have noticed that all my Doom related content is gone.
While this is true, it is due to many of my popular and known works being
Transferred to Sourceforge, as it has better reach on search engines than GitHub.

Many of my older builds have been given to community members to host on FTP servers.

However, since I was unable to communicate this to people on Doomworld, nobody knew.
A few project will not be returning, these are the Boom Editing Utilities and my updated DETH version.
I've since ported the entire Boom Editing Tools including the main program to native Windows, Mac and Linux
but I will never redistribute them again, as if people do not want or respect me, then that applies retroactively
To all my content too.  This isn't in spite, it is so I can focus on what really matters instead of drama.

Keep on developing folks!
