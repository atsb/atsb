Notice 31/07/2022: My Intel Mac died after 9 years.  I will be transitioning all my work to my RHEL system and will no longer be working on any Mac programs.  There is an M1 Mac at home, however it is not mine and so that isn't possible to develop on as I need at least 50GB of developer tools and the significant other would not be pleased.

Therefore, expect all my Mac projects to unfortunately close.  Going forward, Red Hat Enterprise Linux will be my number 1 platform and I will be cross-compiling for Windows.  I have neither the time nor energy to consistently use multiple machines anymore.
