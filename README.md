Note: 30.09.2022 - some have noticed that all my Doom related content is gone.
While this is true, it is due to many of my popular and known works being
transferred to Sourceforge, as it has better reach on search engines than GitHub.

Many of my older builds have been given to community members to host on FTP servers.

However, since I was unable to communicate this to people on Doomworld, nobody knew.
A few projects will not be returning, these are the Boom Editing Utilities and my updated DETH version.
I've since ported the entire Boom Editing Tools including the main program to native Windows, Mac and Linux
but I will not redistribute them again, as I have done that and got no respect for it.

I think many developers would agree, that if a community does not want you, then why would they want
the content you create, for free, in your spare time?  I think this is fair.

Keep on developing folks!  Respect yourselves and respect your craft.

Much love!
